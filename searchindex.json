  "content":"Misuse of bus lanes / jump zones Why we are concerned? The Brisbane Central Business District Bicycle User Group (CBD BUG) is concerned about the ongoing misuse of bus lanes and jump zones by private motorists, which significantly diminishes the benefits of these spaces for cyclists and public transport users. Despite the legal allowance for cyclists to use bus lanes, many drivers ignore this and obstruct the lanes, undermining their intended purpose. Although occasional police enforcement is carried out, it is insufficient to deter this widespread issue due to limited resources. The group is requesting the installation of camera surveillance technology to automatically detect and penalize motorists who violate the rules, particularly in the inner city.\nOur Letter to The Honourable Mark Bailey MP (Minister for Transport and Main Roads) View Letter\nDear Minister\nI write to you on behalf of Brisbane Central Business District Bicycle User Group (CBD BUG) members regarding the need for surveillance technology to be installed to enable enforcement actionin response to the current misuse of bus lanes / jump zones by people driving private motor vehicles.\nAs you are aware people riding bicycles are permitted to ride in bus lanes under s154 of the Transport Operations (Road Use Management—Road Rules) Regulation 2009. While the CBD BUG will always prefer protected infrastructure separated from general traffic on busy roads, bus lanes do offer the ability for riders to travel in a lane void of general traffic with all the associated benefits. Regrettably, many motorists are failing to respect this rule and drive their private motor vehicles in bus lanes, removing any benefit these lanes offer to people on bicycles and public transport users.\nFigures 1 and 2 on the following page were captured on Ann Street at its intersection with James Street during the evening peak travel period showing examples of this widespread and unacceptable situation.\nThe benefits of installing dedicated bus lanes/jump zones to improve public transport services cannot be realized while private motorists are allowed to brazenly flout the law and obstruct these lanes/zones.\nWe are aware police will on an irregular basis perform enforcement action at some of these locations. However, given their finite resources these enforcement exercises are quite infrequent - and hence do not pose a sufficient deterrent to prevent this common motorist misbehaviour.\nAccordingly, the CBD BUG requests your department installs (working with Brisbane City Council if required) camera surveillance technology to automate the detection of these road rule breaches and enable the issuing of infringement notices to private motorists ignoring the road rules and blocking bus lanes/jump zones of Brisbane - with a priority placed on the inner city.\nLooking forward to your reply.\nYours sincerely\nDonald Campbell\nCo-convenor\nBrisbane CBD BUG 09 September 2022\nReply from Minister for Transport and Main Roads View Letter\nDear Mr Campbell\nThank you for your letter of 9 September 2022 about surveillance technology to enable enforcement action in response to the current misuse of bus lanes/jump zones.\nBus jump zones are not specifically covered under the Queensland Road Rules (QRR). I understand these zones are installed by the Brisbane City Council. As such, there is no specific rule that prevents other vehicles from driving in the bus jump zone. There are, however, other road markings and signs that provide for how bus drivers and other road users should navigate these types of intersections.\nAs you have outlined in your letter, there is a ‘left lane must turn left’ sign installed at this location. This sign is accompanied by another sign which exempts buses from this requirement. | note that this rule would also exclude bicycles. The penalty for an offence against this section is $115 and three demerit points (for motor vehicle drivers).\nAs you may be aware, the Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) and the Queensland Police Service (QPS) work together to deliver the Camera Detected Offence Program (CDOP). CDOP oversees site selection and deployment of speed, red-light and mobile phone and seatbelt cameras on the Queensland road network. However, CDOP does not currently deploy cameras that automatically enforce failing to adhere to a ‘left lane must turn left\u0026rsquo; sign.\nI appreciate your advocacy for maintaining road access and safety for bicycle riders. However, there are no current plans to introduce this type of camera enforcement in Queensland.\nWhile TMR is responsible for the QRR, enforcement is the responsibility of the QPS. I encourage you to report any instances of unsafe driving that you witness to Policelink any time by telephone on 131 444 or online at https://www.police.qld.gov.au/policelink-reporting.\nThank you for bringing this matter to my attention. | trust this information is of assistance.\nYours sincerely\nMARK BAILEY MP\nMinister for Transport and Main Roads\nOutcome While the Brisbane Central Business District Bicycle User Group (CBD BUG) appreciates the response from the Minister for Transport and Main Roads, we can’t help but feel a bit disappointed by the outcome. Our request for automated camera enforcement to address the misuse of bus lanes and jump zones was not accepted, and there are no current plans to introduce such technology. While we understand the complexity of the situation and acknowledge the role of law enforcement, the limited resources and lack of automated enforcement continue to undermine the effectiveness of existing measures. However, we remain optimistic and will continue advocating for safer, more effective infrastructure that protects cyclists and public transport users in Brisbane.\n"},{

  "content":"How to Cycle with Your Dog and the Benefits of Cycling Together Cycling with your dog can be a fun and rewarding experience, offering both of you exercise, fresh air, and bonding time. However, ensuring safety and comfort for both you and your furry companion is key. In this article, we’ll cover how to cycle with your dog safely and the many benefits of doing so.\nHow to Cycle with Your Dog Safely 1. Choose the Right Setup Before you hit the road, you need to decide how your dog will accompany you. There are a few common methods:\nRunning alongside on a leash: Best for active, well-trained dogs. Using a bike leash attachment: These keep the dog at a safe distance from the bike and reduce sudden pulling. Dog trailer: Ideal for smaller or older dogs that can’t run long distances. Front or rear basket: Suitable for small dogs who prefer a comfy ride. 2. Train Your Dog Gradually Not all dogs are immediately comfortable running alongside a bike. Start slow:\nWalk the bike while holding your dog’s leash so they get used to being near it. Ride at a slow pace in a safe, open space. Use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior. Gradually increase distance and speed as your dog becomes more confident. 3. Choose Safe Routes Opt for quiet streets, parks, or dedicated bike paths where there is minimal traffic. Avoid busy roads and areas with too many distractions.\n4. Monitor Your Dog’s Health Keep an eye on your dog’s behavior and physical condition:\nMake sure they are not overheating, especially in warm weather. Carry water and take breaks. Watch for signs of fatigue or discomfort. 5. Use Proper Gear Investing in the right equipment can make cycling with your dog safer and more enjoyable:\nBike leash attachment: Prevents sudden pulls and keeps your hands free. Reflective gear: Helps with visibility, especially in low-light conditions. Paw protection: If cycling on rough or hot surfaces, consider dog booties. Helmet and lights (for you): Ensures your safety on the road. The Benefits of Cycling with Your Dog 1. Exercise and Health Benefits Cycling provides excellent cardiovascular exercise for both you and your dog. It helps your dog stay fit, reduces the risk of obesity, and improves overall well-being.\n2. Mental Stimulation for Your Dog Dogs love new environments and experiences. Cycling introduces them to new scents, sights, and sounds, keeping their minds engaged and reducing boredom-related behaviors.\n3. Strengthens Your Bond Spending quality time together strengthens the connection between you and your pet. Shared activities, like cycling, build trust and deepen your relationship.\n4. Saves Time If you’re short on time, cycling with your dog can combine exercise and outdoor time in one activity, ensuring both of you stay active without separate workouts.\n5. Environmentally Friendly Transportation Using a bike instead of a car for trips to the park or errands with your dog reduces your carbon footprint, promoting a greener lifestyle.\nFinal Thoughts Cycling with your dog can be an incredible experience, but safety should always come first. With the right training, gear, and precautions, you and your furry friend can enjoy the many benefits of riding together. So grab your bike, leash up your pup, and hit the road for a healthier and happier adventure!\n"}]
